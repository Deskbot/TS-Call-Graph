=====

* Include references to super classes
* If there is a get and a set property of the same name, they are separate nodes with arrows for sets going to one and arrows for gets going to the other.
* Show whether there are external calls to a public member
* Panning to see graph that goes outside of the specified boundaries
* Download graph as an SVG to preserve manual layout
* Upload graph from an SVG
* Create a webpage from the terminal that only contains the drawing code and not the parsing code
* The edge from a node to itself should be drawn with a curved line
* Automatic node ordering top to bottom by fewest parents at the top, using most children first as a tie breaker
